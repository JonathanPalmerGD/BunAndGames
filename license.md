In the event that an Argzero project becomes an Argzero Technologies, LLC project, you are required to use the business name Argzero Technologies, LLC to give credit for use. This is not true if you used the project before this change occurred and instead you may use Argzero or Forrest Zachary Shooster to give credit.

Otherwise, you may feel free to modify the code or use it in other projects, however know that in modifying the code for your purposes you should (MUST) notify Argzero of your use of APR at his email at forrest@argzero.org. If Argzero is already aware of your use of his project, you are excluded from the requirement of notifying him of your use of the project.
